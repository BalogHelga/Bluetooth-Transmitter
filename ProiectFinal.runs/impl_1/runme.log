WARNING: [DRC 23-20] Rule violation (PDRC-153) Gated clock check - Net enF_reg_i_2_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin enF_reg_i_2/O, cell enF_reg_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
